# arkit-face-blendshapes

https://arkit-face-blendshapes.com/

A website that shows an example of each blendshape that ARKit uses to describe faces. This information can be useful when creating a 3d model you'd like to animate using ARKit; for instance, a model to be used with the "Perfect Sync" feature of [VMagicMirror](https://malaybaku.github.io/VMagicMirror/en/tips/perfect_sync) or [vear](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/id1490697369).

## Notes

`tongueOut` is currently missing because I couldn't find an image or model for it.
